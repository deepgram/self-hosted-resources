      # `chart-releaser-action` only performs a `git diff` on Chart files. If we have a workflow where we want to
      # merge something without bumping the Chart version yet to create a release, the chart-releaser-action will
      # fail, since git detects that changes have been made, but the Chart version wasn't bumped. We don't want an
      # erroneous failure in this case, as that dev workflow is intentional. So this step detects if the Helm chart
      # version was bumped, and only continues if it was.
      #
      # This relies on PRs being squashed when merged (as it compares the head commit to its parent).
      # This is currently enforced in the repositories PR settings.
